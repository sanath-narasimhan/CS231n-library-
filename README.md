# CS231n-library-fnn

### An implementation of Assignment-2 Stanford Course CS231n on Convolutional Neural Networks

>fully_connected_net.py

Has a class FullyConnectedNet that takes and argument 

        - hidden_dims: A list of integers giving the size of each hidden layer.
        - input_dim: An integer giving the size of the input.
        - num_classes: An integer giving the number of classes to classify.
        - dropout: Scalar between 0 and 1 giving dropout strength. If dropout=1 then
          the network should not use dropout at all.
        - normalization: What type of normalization the network should use. Valid values
          are "batchnorm", "layernorm", or None for no normalization (the default).
        - reg: Scalar giving L2 regularization strength.
        - weight_scale: Scalar giving the standard deviation for random
          initialization of the weights.
        - dtype: A numpy datatype object; all computations will be performed using
          this datatype. float32 is faster but less accurate, so you should use
          float64 for numeric gradient checking.
        - seed: If not None, then pass this random seed to the dropout layers. This
          will make the dropout layers deteriminstic so we can gradient check the
          model.
